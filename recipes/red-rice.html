            <li>3 1/2 cups hot water</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Wash rice thoroughly. Drain excess water.</li>

                and achote powder.</li>
            <li>Add green onions</li>
            <li>Carefully pour hot water into the pot. Stir to combine all the ingredients and to dissolve the achote powder and Dashida. the bacon fat will start to melt; don't worry if it doesnt cmpletely melt at this time.</li>
            <li>Turn the rice cooker to the "cook" setting. The only thing left to do is to stir the rice a couple more times. wait acouple of minutes then stir to ensure even mixing after the bacon fat melted. Wait another 5 mins or so and stir once more to ensure the rice at the bottom of the pot is evenly coated with achote coloring.
